<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm Josh Clune, a fifth year PhD student studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm interested in logic and its interaction with computer science, which has lead me to explore programming language theory, SAT and SMT solving, and interactive and automatic theorem proving. My current research focuses on the development of general-purpose automation for interactive theorem provers.</p>

<p>I am grateful to currently be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/">Jeremy Avigad</a>.</p>
