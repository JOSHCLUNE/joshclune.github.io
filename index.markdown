<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm Josh Clune, a first year PhD student studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focus is pretty broad and underspecified, but generally speaking, I find myself drawn to logic and its interaction with computer science. This has spawned interests in programming language theory, SAT/SMT solving, and interactive/automated theorem proving.</p>

<p>I am grateful to currently be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/">Jeremy Avigad</a>.</p>
